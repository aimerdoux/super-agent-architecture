## Self-Evolution Session

### Memory System Upgraded
- **Changed**: Pinecone → Local embeddings only
- **Reason**: Privacy-first, no cloud dependencies
- **Config**: Ollama `nomic-embed-text` + SQLite with sqlite-vec

### Heartbeat Activated
- Created `HEARTBEAT.md` with proactive checklist
- Added heartbeat state tracking (`memory/heartbeat-state.json`)
- Heartbeat runs every 30 minutes during active hours (8 AM - 11 PM)

### Meta-Goals Framework Created
- Created `GOALS.md` for self-evolution tracking
- Defined 4 core objectives: Memory, Proactive, Self-Awareness, Learning
- Added progress tracking table and self-modification log

### AGENTS.md Updated
- Removed Pinecone references
- Updated memory indexing documentation for local-only mode
- Simplified memory storage instructions

### MEMORY.md Enhanced
- Added user preferences (privacy-first, heartbeat enabled)
- Added memory maintenance protocol
- Added meta-goals section
